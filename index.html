                Badminton is a racquet sport in which players use racquets to strike a shuttlecock over a net. While it can be played with larger teams, the most common formats are singles (one player per side) and doubles (two players per side). The game is often enjoyed casually outdoors—such as in a yard or on a beach—while competitive matches are held indoors on a rectangular court. Points are scored by hitting the shuttlecock so that it lands within the opposing side’s boundaries.

                Each side is allowed only one hit before the shuttlecock must cross the net. A rally ends when the shuttlecock touches the ground or when a fault is called by the umpire, service judge, or—if officials are absent—the opposing side.

                The shuttlecock, made of feathers or plastic (in informal play), behaves differently from the balls used in most other sports. Its feathers create significant drag, causing it to slow down rapidly after being struck. Despite this rapid deceleration, the shuttlecock can reach exceptionally high speeds, making badminton the fastest racquet sport in the world. Its distinctive flight pattern defines the nature of the game and even influences its name in some languages—for example, in German, Federball (“feather ball”).

                Badminton evolved in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. Although Denmark historically dominated European competition, the sport has become especially popular across Asia. It made its Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Games with four events: men’s singles, women’s singles, men’s doubles, and women’s doubles; mixed doubles was added in 1996. At the highest levels, badminton demands exceptional aerobic endurance, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a highly technical sport, requiring advanced motor coordination and refined racquet control, particularly through flexible and precise wrist movements.
