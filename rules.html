		<h1>Badminton Rules</h1>
		<p>Below are concise rules and guidelines for playing badminton. This covers basic play, scoring, service, faults, and common match regulations.</p>

		<h2>General Play</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Match formats: singles (1 vs 1) and doubles (2 vs 2). Mixed doubles consist of one male and one female player per side.</li>
			<li>A match is the best of three games. Each game is played to 21 points (rally scoring).</li>
			<li>A point is scored on every rally, regardless of which side served.</li>
			<li>If the score reaches 20–20, play continues until one side gains a 2-point lead (e.g., 22–20). If the score reaches 29–29, the side scoring the 30th point wins the game.</li>
			<li>Players change ends after each game, and in the third game they change ends when the leading score reaches 11 points.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Service Rules</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The server and receiver must stand within their respective service courts without touching the boundary lines until the service is made.</li>
			<li>The shuttle must be struck below the server's waist (defined as the lowest rib) and the racket head must point downwards at the moment of impact.</li>
			<li>The server and receiver must have both feet in contact with the court surface and remain stationary until the service is delivered.</li>
			<li>Serve direction: diagonal from server's service court to the opponent's corresponding service court.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Common Faults</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The shuttle lands outside the court boundaries.</li>
			<li>The shuttle passes through or under the net, or fails to pass over the net.</li>
			<li>Player touches the net or its supports with racket, person, or clothing.</li>
			<li>Player deliberately distracts an opponent (e.g., loud shouts as the shuttle is struck).</li>
			<li>Double hit: the shuttle is struck twice by the same player or team.</li>
		</ol>
