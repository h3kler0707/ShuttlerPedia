		<section class="history-content container">
			<p>Badminton evolved from an ancient game called battledore and shuttlecock. The modern game developed in India during the 1800s among British military officers. It was named after the Duke of Beaufort's home, Badminton House, in England. The game gradually became more organized with published rules and directions.</p>

			<p>Badminton became very popular in India by the 1870s. A similar game called ball badminton, played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was also played in the same region. Players chose whichever version worked best for the weather conditions.</p>

			<p>The game was also called "Poona" after the Indian city where the first official rules were written in 1873. By 1875, British officers brought the game back to England and started the first badminton club. The game worked best with two or four players. Early shuttlecocks were made with India rubber and sometimes weighted with lead to control their flight.</p>

			<p>The rules of badminton were refined over time. In 1893, the Badminton Association of England officially published the game's rules and launched it formally. The first major competition, the All England Open Badminton Championships, started in 1899. It included doubles matches for men and women, with singles added in 1900.</p>

			<p>The International Badminton Federation was founded in 1934 to organize the sport worldwide. Today, the top badminton players come from Asian countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India. China is currently the strongest badminton nation in the world. While badminton started in England, it is now played competitively across the globe.</p>

			<p>Today, badminton is enjoyed both as a competitive sport and as a casual backyard game around the world.</p>
